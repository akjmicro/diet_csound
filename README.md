# DIET CSOUND
Version 7.0.0 (beta)

A sound and music computing system.

`Diet Csound` is a fork of Csound, brought to you by Aaron Krister Johnson.

The goal was to strip down to a curated set of what I deem "essential" opcodes,
in order to make the system smaller/leaner/cleaner. Along the way, when I see
code that could be put in a better organization, or prettified, I do!

What you might consider "essential" might vary from what I do, (and myself
at different times) but hopefully, the system starting from a smaller place
would be a good thing for you all as well, and maybe you can customize your
system as I do.

As time goes on, I'll provide customization instructions that go deeper into
how you can hack your system.
